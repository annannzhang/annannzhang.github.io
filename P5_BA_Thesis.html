                This thesis unpacks the most recent preservation program (2005-2019) at
                Wukang Mansion in Shanghai’s former French Concession and city center and
                illustrates the program frames Wukang Mansion into a collective reimagination and
                reconstruction of a cosmopolitanism ideal rooted in early 20th century Shanghai.
                Currently at Wukang Mansion and Wukang Road area, we see that later emerged
                modern elements were cast onto the neoclassical pre-1930s mansion and
                incorporated into the preservation program to recreate the 1930s cosmopolitan
                Shanghai. By referring to a variety of sources from oral history of the residents to
                planners’ journal article and anchoring theories in science and technology studies
                on architectural studies, this thesis critically analyzes how modern Art Deco visual
                style emerged in 1930s induced the contemporary cosmopolitan ideal in the 21st
                century, among both the general outside tourists and three groups of actors (i.e.,
                residents, planners, and investors) in the preservation program. Their actions in
                utilizing different means of science and technology available to realize their
                diverging versions of the ideal forms interesting interactions and compromises.
                With their collective effort, Wukang Mansion is empowered as a time machine for
                the audience to travel back into a reimagined 1930s “old Shanghai.” In alignment,
                the most recent commercial projects in the area are masked in a cosmopolitan look
                and curated for the outside tourists. Using Wukang Mansion and Wukang Road as
                an example, the thesis ends with a timely discussion of the impact of COVID-19
                and the emergence of social media on domestic historical tourism in Shanghai.
