                    <B>Where has development been happening in the City of Los Angeles in the past decade? </B>
                    This project aims to explore this question through looking at a series of indicators that may 
                    help us grasp a better idea of this question. 
                    The indicators are grouped and examined by tier 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 â€“ higher tier means more direct 
                    relevance to development activities. Please refer to <b><i>Diagram on the left</i></b>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Tier 1</b> consists of number of finaled permits and Certificate of Occupancy, 
                    which directly represents completed projects in the city. <br>
                    <b> Tier 1.5</b> looks at number of total permits submitted and issued permits, which suggest an overall development interest and hence potential. <br>
                    <b> Tier 2 </b> contains valuation and area value suggested in building permits dataset. It is placed towards the bottom because of potential missing or outdated data for certain projects, hence, not completely reliable. <br>
                    <b> Tier 3 </b> is drawn from Census (ACS 5 year estimates) and Census on the Map on population and job growth over the periods of study. This is a relatively indirect indicator of where development or growth has been happening. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    In addition, Zillow Housing Value Index is referenced but not included in the modeling process, primarily due to absence of a reliable geographic reference of neighborhoods listed on Zillow using Community Planning Area (CPA) or Neighborhoods, both of which are officially established by the City of Los Angeles. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b> How should we characterize growth and stagnation of development in Los Angeles? </b> In this project, development from 2010 to 2022 is examined at a neighborhood scale and categorized into 4 groups listed below:
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Neighborhoods with <u>constant development</u> through out (2010 - 2022) </b></li>
                        <li><b>Neighborhoods underwent development in <u>recent years</u> (2016 - 2022)</b></li> 
                        <li><b>Neighborhoods underwent development in <u>early 2010's but stopped
                            midway (currently stagnated or slowed down)</u> (2010 - 2015)</b></li>
                        <li><b>Neighborhoods experienced <u>little to no development</u></b></li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <br>
                    Note that the development growth in individual neighborhood is examined relative to the rest
                    in the city -- this is for better directing attention and resources to those 'relatively under' developed neighborhood within the City. 
                    Trends would be very differently if put on a national scale. Using indicators identified in tiers, neighborhoods are assessed by scoring in the two time frame (2010 - 2015 and 2016 - 2022) --
                     if one falls in top 50% that is 1 point, bottom 50% means 0 point. If one scores 1 in both time frame, that suggests a constant growth, opposite means little to no growth. The 4 categories can be illustrated by the <b><i>diagram on the right.</i></b>
